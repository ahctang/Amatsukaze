A nice change of pace from the typical Human/Demon war show. If you were in to the Spice & Wolf style, I think you`ll like this.

<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="186852">
Avoid this. It really does not deserve its rating. It could have been great, but they tried to shoehorn what appears to be an amazing epic story into 12 episodes. It would have needed *at least* twice as many. It feels like you are watching it in fast-forward the way it becomes all disjointed by the many events they cram into it at the end.

To enjoy Maoyuu one needs about a barrel of willing suspension of disbelief to ignore all the out of place tech and discoveries. [spoiler]By far the worst offender is trench warfare tactics in middle ages where they don`t even seem to have cannons, a precursor to accurate and sure to fire rifles and automated guns that made standing in clear view a very bad idea. A barrel of the good stuff might not be enough to let that slide![/spoiler]

this will give a good ideam of the differences in raiting : this series is great, a bit of romancem together with some action, and realy fun to watch. That said, how can so little like it? the end.... the whole series, i`d propaply give a must see/9.5 though, the series combined with the ending? recomended/5..... you could say that the ending is watching halv a movie, or that if they make a sequel, the rating on this series will automaticly go up. another way to say it, is like watching Maken-ki, before the 2nd season was announced.

<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="53032">
A deconstructive, affectionate parody of the shonen JRPG genre that doesn`t get half the episodes it required and deserves to properly convey the interconnecting elements and underlying depth of its story and themes. Unfortunately, this resulted in a quite seriously flawed adaptation, though a fair number of scenes still held up well as parts of an interconnecting whole, tantalisingly hinting at what could have been.

Really enjoyed it! Very refreshing as i do find a lot of anime these days to be generic. Voice acting and drawing style gets top marks. Not as complex as other users would have you believe, but it do offer a extra set of enjoyment if you have knowledge of feudalism,history,economics or feudal warfare. But by no means are they necessary cause it`s still fairly easy stuff within those categories - but you can tell the effort into making a beliveable world/universe. It has one flaw however, not enough episodes so it is rushed at parts. But all in all really good watch i`d have no problem recommending.

<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="148166">
Very interesting series, if you want a show similar to Spice & Wolf with its mix of economics, focus on character interactions and a dash of sex appeal .. then by all means go for it, this one even expands things further by taking the economic to a larger scale and involving politics and warfare into the mix ... ignore all the blabbering about how shallow the characters are or how it`s just a fanservice show, that`s just utter nonsense, the character immediately show depth by ep2 and the fanservice is used correctly for once to serve the plot while also serving its other purposes (teasing the viewers and sometimes even for a good laugh).

Pleasant watch, with strong fundamentals in relation to reality.

<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="257071">
A small part of a larger story, with more things unexplained, or barely touched on, than any series I`ve seen in years. While some parts of the story are so ridiculous and/or common as to be close to parody (many of the characters` names are their titles, for instance, like "yuusha" and "maou"), other parts of the story are so realistic as to be shocking. Don`t expect an action title, this show is more about economics and forward-thinking than combat. If you`re looking for a drama title with some romance and a non-traditional story, give this a shot for sure. Someday they may decide to finish this, but even if they don`t, it`s still worth checking out.
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="330647">
This is a definite must-see for those who enjoy anime series such as "Spice and Wolf". It has a very respectable execution, making it a very, very appealing watch. Do not miss out!
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="481279">
A simple yet deep tale about war, peace, social & economic strife, the human condition, and how right-minded individuals working together can change the world. Set in a fictional medieval world, this show addresses issues that have plagued humanity for centuries: war, plague, famine, social inequality, slavery, ignorance/prejudice, exploitation, and corrupt leadership. Although it approaches these topics in a fairly simple & straightforward manner, it still captures the essence and impact it has on the individual and the society as a whole. On the side it has a developing cute romance between the main characters with plenty of ecchi to go around. The scenery is artistically rendered and animation is fluid. Its only real shortcoming is its briefness. How it ends leaves a slight possibility for a second season, but if it never happens, then how it ends is still sufficient in my opinion. A anime worth watching if you enjoy politics, strategy, drama, and/or cute romantic comedies.

The story is set in a world embroiled by war between Humans and Demons. The Humans` greatest hero invades the Demon Queen`s castle determined to vanquish her. However, instead of fighting back, the Queen proposes an alliance with the Hero. She explains how a sudden end to the war can bring further chaos to the world as the Humans once united to stand against their common enemies would eventually begin fighting among themselves, with similar issues already occurring at the Demon Realm. Convinced by her words, the Hero joins forces with the Queen and together they execute a plan to bring prosperity and a lasting peace to both Humans and Demons alike. Source: Wikipedia

<name>juujin</name>
<description>
Kemono, "beast", is a genre of Japanese art and character design that prominently features anthropomorphic animal characters. It is used widely in visual arts, especially drawing and painting, and can be found in many manga, anime, and video game. Anthropomorphic animal characters in the kemono genre are frequently called juujin, "therianthrope"; the kanji for juujin are also sometimes pronounced kemonobito, "beast-human". While their design differs from artist to artist, they generally employ animal traits considered cute and endearing; most kemono characters retain a fundamentally human personality, however, seldom behaving as the actual animals from which they have been anthropomorphized, and as such they are typically depicted living as humans do.

Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.

<description>
A maid is a female employed in domestic service. They usually wear uniforms. Since their nature is to be obedient and serve their goshujin-sama (master), they are one of the most desired types of women in Japan, a dream of every Japanese man, particularly http://anidb.net/l219 [otaku]. Often seen in so-called Maid Cafes in Akihabara, where male customers can for a little time enjoy the feeling of being served by a woman. The male gender opposite is the butler.

Very intelligent mythical beings - a cross between a very large lizard and a dinosaur - that breath fire, and have a knack for kidnapping damsels, thus distressing them. In Fantasy anime this perceptive species often lives secluded from human civilisation, protectors of long lost knowledge. Dragons seem to be on the verge of extinction.

The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence.

<description>
Some of the central structural elements in anime are: Plot Continuity How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters? Stereotype Characters Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists. Plot Twists Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.

<name>target audience</name>
<description>
Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment. The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.

<description>
Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>
Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows.

Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography and sociology, and also on folklore.

Note: Just because the anime contains a guy or a couple of guys with swords wondering about, doesn`t make it applicable for this category, unless there are larger military organizations/groups involved in armed conflict with each other, you might not want to add this genre.

<description>
A magic circle is circle or sphere of space marked out by practitioners of many branches of ritual magic. It may be marked physically, drawn in salt or chalk, for example, or merely visualised. Traditionally, circles have been used by ritual magicians to form a protective barrier between themselves and what they summoned. Nowadays, circles often have the more benign function of containing and concentrating the energy raised during a ritual. Circles can also be used as barriers for non-magical work such as meditation. Generally, as with most magical practices, an incantation is recited stating the purpose and nature of the circle, often repeating an assortment of divine and angelic names. Source: wiki

<description>
Sexual abuse is the act of one person forcing sexual behavior upon another. Sexual abuse includes not only physical coercion and sexual assault, especially rape, but also psychological abuse, such as verbal sexual behaviour or stalking, including emotional manipulation. The sexual abuse tag is only meant for non-pornographic works; for pornography, the http://anidb.net/t2715 [rape] tag should be used instead.

<description>
Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction). In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today. Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture Source: Wiki

<description>
Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience. Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>
Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi. The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai". The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>harem</name>
<description>
Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/l511 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle. As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well. Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".

The antics of the protagonists do not take place in some exotic setting or time, but in everyday life. When not "at the job" this means getting up in the morning, making meals, house cleaning, going shopping or out to eat, visiting the bath house or spa, leisure activities in the spare time, etc. The time "on the job" for students is School Life, for others working in their profession. Daily Life is basically a synonym for everything normal, repetitive, and trivial happening to your average person.

<name>dystopia</name>
<description>
A dystopia (from Ancient Greek: δυσ-, "bad, ill", and Ancient Greek: τόπος, "place, landscape"; alternatively cacotopia, or anti-utopia) is, in literature, an often futuristic society that has degraded into a repressive and controlled state, often under the guise of being utopian. Dystopian literature has underlying cautionary tones, warning society that if we continue to live how we do, this will be the consequence. A dystopia, thus, is regarded as a sort of negative utopia and is often characterized by an authoritarian or totalitarian form of government. Dystopias usually feature different kinds of repressive social control systems, a lack or total absence of individual freedoms and expressions and constant states of warfare or violence. Dystopias often explore the concept of humans abusing technology and how humans individually and collectively cope with technology that has evolved too quickly such as the car, the flamethrower or the microwave. A dystopian society is also often characterized by widespread poverty and brutal political controls such as a large military-like police.

<description>
War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively). Source: wiki

<name>incomplete story</name>
<description>
The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely, leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes. In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues. An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.

Sometimes it`s used as a disguise, other times it`s used as a decoy and destraction, even simply being used as a weapon and piece of armor that the possessor uses to cause sheer chaos and destruction, but sometimes... a host can be used for fetish fuel.

The main female protagonist and the supreme ruler of the Demon Realm. Soon after Demon Queen and the Hero join forces, she sets for the Human Realm, disguising herself as a human noblewoman known as the Crimson Scholar (紅の学士 Kurenai no Gakushi), and sharing a part of her vast knowledge with the Human society to help improve their civilization. Becoming famous in the Human World not only by her feats, but also by her beauty, the Crimson Scholar is viewed with distrust by the church who brands her as a heretic in spite of her growing influence, fearing it would loosen its grasp over the countries helped by her. To ensure a temporary ceasefire between the Humans and Demons, the Demon Queen disseminates rumors that her battle with the Hero indeed occurred, resulting in his disappearance and her body becoming severely wounded, thus leading her servants to the false belief that she would not be able to command them until her recuperation is completed.

He is an unequaled swordsman capable of standing against the strongest Human or Demon, along with being capable of powerful magic ranging from healing to creating familiar spirits, and able to instantly teleport to any location he previously visited. He eventually develops feelings for the Demon Queen which are also requited. As part of the Demon Queen`s plan, he conceals his true identity and adopts the name of White Swordsman (白の剣士 Shiro no Kenshi). While traveling through the Demon Realm as a peacekeeper, he dons an imposing black armor belonging to a former Demon Lord, addressing himself as a servant of the Demon Queen called the Black Knight (黒騎士 Kuro Kishi). The Hero used to fight along three companions, a Female Knight, an Archer and a Wizard who followed their separate ways after the Hero left the party to confront the Demon Queen by himself.

The Young Merchant is representing the Merchants, and a very cunning business entrepreneur. First sceptical about the Crimson Scholar, he realizes fast that her methods might lead to him being able to expand his fortune on a large scale. He eventually involves the whole kingdom into his scheme, raising up the prices of certain foods. He says at first he is a merchant, then a human, which is why he also starts to trade with the Demon Realm after having been approached by the Dragon Princess.

One of the members of Hero`s old party. A powerful swordswoman who also excels as a commander in battle. She reunites with the Hero by accident much to her surprise, as no one had news from him since his encounter with the Demon Queen. Despite she fails to get a proper explanation from him, she joins the Crimson Scholar`s efforts to improve Human society by teaching swordsmanship to her students. The Female Knight eventually becomes a close friend to the Demon Queen, staying by her side even after learning about her true identity, but also viewing her as a rival for the hero`s affection as she also loves him.

One of the members of Hero`s previoius party. After the split, she set out alone for the Demon Realm to look for him. Learning of it, the Hero starts looking for clues about her whereabouts during his travels through the Demon Realm. She has two other personalities - apparently her dead sisters` spirits - that can only be seen by her but manifest themselves through a change in her tone of voice to others. The main personality, Silver (銀 - Gin), likes sleeping best and lies dormant most of the time. The second personality, White (白 - Shiro), is really good in analyzing situations theoretically. The third personality, Indigo (藍 - Ao), has a very wild and violent nature. Source: en.wiki and jap.wiki

The White Night King is the king of the White Night kingdom. Unlike his Southern counterparts, which end up adopting the improvements offered by Crimson Scholar, he chooses to align with the Central kingdoms instead. Arrogant and uncaring, he refuse to take responsibility when his attempt to reclaim Aurora Island fails which led to many deaths, including the first Winter King who he tries to blame on his failure. After the rest of the Southern leaders call out on his behaviour, he gives command of the next Aurora Island expedition to the new Winter King to see if he can do better but much to his anger, the Winter King succeeds in what he failed to do. With his kingdom being left out the economic pact between the Winter, Ice and Iron kingdoms, White Night King becomes jealous and swears revenge on the other Southern nations. Source: en.wiki

This old archer (Rou Yumihei) was a member of the hero`s old party. He`s very interested in the female chest and likes to mention Female Knights lack of thereof. He addresses concerns about Hero isolating himself from humanity due to his immense power. His title comes from the fact that he can inflict arrow-like wounds from afar, despite he is never seen carrying a bow or any kind of long range weapon. After the party split, he started to work as a butler (Shitsuji) for the Winter Prince.

The former Commander of the Crusaders that controlled Gateway city and leader of White Night Kingdom`s army. Under his rule, his Crusaders treated the demons harshly. As he and his Crusaders lost their sanity and morale due to the Black Knight and his allies` illusion magic, his army abandoned the city with the excuse that he was helping to reclaim Aurora Island. Unfortunately, he and his Crusaders were met by the demon armies who had controlled Aurora Island and were forced to retreat due to the Winter Kingdom forces. After a brutal battle, his whole army was wiped out, though the Commander himself was able to escape back to the Central Kingdoms. Nevertheless, he was arrested and sentenced to death by the Central Church for abandoning Gateway City and his crushing defeat at the hands of the demons. Source: en.wiki
