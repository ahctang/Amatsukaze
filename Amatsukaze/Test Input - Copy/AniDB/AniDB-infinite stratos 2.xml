Was a little bit disappointing comparing to IS1 it looks like 2nd season was full of fillers...
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="248649">
Prolly only for fans not of the serie but for fans of fanservice and nonsense fillers. That was really a disappointing S2 I hope if the producers want to continue the IS legacy They turn on the right track.

<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="515975">
Some of the recommendations I see for this season are a bit odd. Seems like the majority are looking for more fan service and ecchi. Instead this season still has elements of that, but a more developed plot and a bit of a darker tone to the story. You still have the harem, but it`s not quite as over the top. I thought it was a great 2nd season.
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="510875">
Make sure you`ve watched IS1. This season tries to pick up loose ends, and it somewhat succeeds. Only major issue here is the lack of action, and more fan service, which can make or break an anime. New character or two, plus some old faces reappear from IS1. Ichika still clueless as hell. Ceilia should be banned from the kitchen at all costs.
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="556522">
if you want to watch this, do watch season 1 first. because this is the continuation of it.. because it has no recap where it left off.. unless perhaps you have read the light novel of this series, feel free to watch it then. over all it`s a great series that is somewhat under-rated by some people... because of the fan services i guess? also if you ended up wondering why things turned out like that. try reading the Light Novel of it... it will really help and you will see the difference from the anime adaptation.

<description>
* Based on a light novel series by http://anidb.net/cr20199 [Yumizuru Izuru], illustrated by http://anidb.net/cr22098 [Okiura]. The students at the IS Academy are trained to become pilots for the Infinite Stratos (IS) weapon system. And http://anidb.net/ch20537 [Orimura Ichika] is the only male among the otherwise female students at the academy capable of piloting an IS. Much to the chagrin of the five girls — ojou-sama http://anidb.net/ch20534 [Cecilia Alcott], sporty http://anidb.net/ch28544 [Charlotte Dunois], girly http://anidb.net/ch20538 [Huang LingYin], sober http://anidb.net/ch20535 [Laura Bodewig], and tsundere http://anidb.net/ch20536 [Shinonono Houki] — that already have a crush on Ichika, other rivals appear... Such as the mischievous and quite direct student council president http://anidb.net/ch55192 [Sarashiki Tatenashi] who forces Ichika into additional "training", to improve his skills in combat. Or a previously unknown little sister, http://anidb.net/ch60201 [Orimura Madoka], in cohorts with some enemy force, linked to the worldwide theft of IS units. Or Tatenashi`s shy younger sister http://anidb.net/ch55193 [Sarashiki Kanzashi] Ichika is asked to team up with for the upcoming tag matches. — written by foo2

<description>
An energetic character, often also called a genki character, shows great, often excessive levels of activity or vitality, and seems to always be doing everything extra fast. Genki characters are often slightly, or sometimes very, eccentric, and are filled with confidence and determination, regardless of whether they are competent or not; in fact, they often have little to no actual competence at whatever they generally do. Although genki characters are usually played exclusively for comedy effect, sometimes they may slow down for a serious or introspective moment. The most common genki character archetype is the genki schoolgirl, who will often be late to school and run with a toast in her mouth.

<description>
Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.

<name>swimsuit</name>
<description>
A swimsuit is one of several kinds of garments designed to be worn by people engaging in water-based activities or sports or during certain activities under sunlight. Most kinds of swimsuit reveal a large portion of the body surface area, but exceptions exist. The more revealing kinds may also be worn as undergarment in sports that require wetsuits, or when there is a need to display the body, as in the case of beauty pageants or bodybuilding contests. There is a very wide range of styles of modern swimsuits, which vary in relation to body coverage and materials. The choice of style of swimsuit is dependent on current fashions, community standards of modesty, and plain personal preference. Swimsuits for men usually expose the chest, while those for women do not usually do so; however, many women prefer to engage in water or sun activities with their torso uncovered, in a practice commonly described as toplessness or topfreedom. Since the early twentieth century a naturist movement has developed in western countries that seeks a return to non-sexual nakedness when swimming and during other appropriate activities; in some places around the world, nude beaches have been set aside for people who choose to engage in normal beach activities in the nude, and such beaches may or may not enforce nudity onto their goers. In anime, it is common for at least one episode to feature the characters in swimsuits, usually as an excuse for gratuitous fanservice; when that happens, the episode is usually labeled a pool or beach episode, after the place the characters went to. Swimsuits, and in particular one-piece swimsuits, are a very common fetish in Japan; while the reason for that is uncertain, a common folk explanation is the fact that boys throughout their entire adolescence are commonly exposed to their female classmates wearing them, in what might be called an experiment in sexual discovery waiting to happen.

<description>
A Catgirl (nekomusume, 猫娘) is a girl that has a cat`s characteristics. They can appear either as normal girls, without any obvious cat traits, such as eyes, ears, tail or paws, or as girls who have one or more of these traits. In the former case they are usually cats that have become human through the means of magic. Not to be confused with characters who simply have a pair of cat ears (nekomimi, 猫耳) as fashion accessory on their head, usually associated with otaku culture.

<description>
The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<description>
Some of the central structural elements in anime are: Plot Continuity How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters? Stereotype Characters Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists. Plot Twists Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.

<name>target audience</name>
<description>
Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment. The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.

<name>themes</name>
<description>
Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>
Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows.

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>
"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR" If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice. It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE. A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime. [Source: TV Tropes]

<description>
Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it. This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.

<name>Earth</name>
<description>
The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.

Mecha in Japanese basically means mechanical things; everything from an electric whisk or a car to a spaceship or a robot. Here however we limit it to the more exotic things usually referred to as mecha anime: robots, whether controlled by a human or not, and their ilk. See Androids, Piloted Robots, Power Suits, Robot Helpers, Transforming Robots for a more specific classification.

Power Suits are similar to Piloted Robots which are controlled from inside the robot except that Power Suits tend to be more directly tied to how the character moves and they are usually not as big as Piloted Robots can be. They are still mechanical and shouldn`t be confused with plug suits.

<name>general lack of common sense</name>
<description>
Often a desired backdrop to many anime-comedy series, where most happenings are fast paced and senseless for the pure comical enjoyment of viewers. The lacking of common sense describes a conflicting existence to which some or many people don`t share the majority`s general knowledge of all things, all possible actions and all the logical results of those actions. In spite of a character`s intelligence (although senselessness may suggest some may be lacking average knowledge), most instances receive illogical results or the events themselves are illogical, therefore the events make just as little sense as the results to follow.

True for almost all anime with school setting, there will be a school excursion or field trip. Tokyo and Kyoto seem to be particularly popular as sightseeing destinations.

Potential for ecchi moments: Obviously the "boys" will get all sorts of ideas with the "girls" sleeping so close by.

Large breasts are larger than average breasts, usually found in adolescent girls or fully grown women; in anime, this includes breasts that are bigger than real life natural ones, sometimes as big as the character`s head or possibly a bit bigger. However, breasts that take at least as much space as the rest of the chest or the abdomen, or that are almost as big but have an absurdly unnatural shape, are the less common http://anidb.net/t1774 [gigantic breasts] instead.

<name>violent retribution for accidental infringement</name>
<description>
A comedy / slapstick element often found in Ecchi anime: The hilarity derives from spontaneous embarrassment, overreaction of the "victim" (girl), immediate retribution for a seemingly inappropriate act, and a sense of pity with the supposed "aggressor" (boy). Typically a boy will - through no fault of his own - stumble into a girl, thus invading her personal space. In the process the boy may e.g. pull down her skirt, grab the girl`s breasts, or accidentally kiss her. Any level-headed girl would see the accident just for what it is. Not so the girl with an overly developed sense of modesty, and a thing for violence. She - often a tsundere - will clobber the boy with excessive brutality.

<description>
Comedy element: Especially in a school setting the character who has fallen for a fellow student, but has not yet confessed his/her love, will be desperate for any sign of "closeness". The indirect kiss: Anything the adored person touches with his/her lips — e.g. a used glass of lemonade, some half-eaten food, a half-emptied can of soda — the love struck will want to touch with her/his own lips.

The character`s face is pressed into a female`s cleavage. This may be accidental or actually intended by the female character, or even a result of a device by the other character. This action is generally seen as sexually charged by the viewers and often also by the cast, so it will usually happen in an ecchi context; as such, something such as a mother hugging her child won`t generally count.

Worn clothing appears paper-thin and takes little abuse to be shredded or torn from the body.

<description>
Japanese for "transformation" (metamorphosis or disguise). A "henshin anime" is any anime, where the characters or their costumes transform, such as Sailor Moon. The henshin switches on the character`s special powers, and is frequently accompanied by a costume change. Often the change of clothing is the only outward indicator that the character has changed and yet nobody seems to notice the hero`s true self. Most henshin heroes have a special item which they use to change into their heroic form. These items are usually activated by a command phrase (which is often in Engrish, for some reason), triggering a transformation sequence.

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>
Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi. The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai". The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>harem</name>
<description>
Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/l511 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle. As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well. Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".

Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school.

<description>
In medias res, also medias in res (Latin for "into the midst of affairs (lit. into mid-affairs)"), refers to a literary and artistic technique where the narrative starts in the middle of the story instead of from its beginning. The characters, setting, and conflict are often introduced through a series of flashbacks or through characters relating past events to each other. Probably originating from an oral tradition, the technique is a convention of epic poetry, one of the earliest and most prominent examples in Western literature being Homer`s Odyssey and Iliad. Virgil`s Aeneid began the tradition in literature of imitating Homer, continued in Torquato Tasso`s Jerusalem Delivered, John Milton`s Paradise Lost and "Inferno" from Dante`s Divine Comedy. George Lucas`s Star Wars saga was told using in medias res.

One of the protagonists (usually male) gives another character (usually female) a ride on the back. Can be interpreted as a sign of closeness or endearment in a romance setting. Reasons: The female character is exhausted from previous running, or has a fit of anaemia, or hurt herself and no longer can walk.

<name>female warriors</name>
<description>
Females who are portrayed as particularly experienced in warfare or combative settings. They have well toned vigor and aggressiveness in battle, often with personalities valuing honour, faith, loyalty and courage. Weapons of choice are usually of the hand-to-hand-combat or melee variety (such as the sword and shield combination). Their attire is commonly comprised of suits of armor - although depending on genre, may seem to be more for display purposes while lacking in concealment of certain vital portions of the body. In most high fantasies, there stands no bounds of limitation between the size and attributes of the warrior in comparison to that of the nature of weapons and equipment they wield. Some may even use long range weaponry (such as bows/crossbows) or magic.

<name>pool episode</name>
<description>
An episode playing at the pool, mostly in school, sometimes outside of it when the cast does not have a chance for a beach episode. Usually used for fanservice purpose as it gives the staff the opportunity to draw the characters in swimsuits and raise the DVD sales. The cheap version of the http://anidb.net/t5846 [beach episode]. Other variants are the http://anidb.net/t3444 [onsen episode] and the http://anidb.net/t2830 [furo scene], used when it is too cold for a beach/pool episode. See also http://anidb.net/t2830 [furo scene].

<name>physical examination</name>
<description>
A comedy element with ecchi potential in your typical school setting: The (especially female) cast is measured for weight, height and other measurements by the school’s nurse. The female cast may then be upset about the lack of “development” in certain areas, or shocked about a perceived weight gain. The male cast on the other hand will try to “sneak a peek”.

<name>3D CG animation</name>
<description>
Abbreviation for "three-dimensional computer generated animation" or "computer graphics" (CGI). The traditional 2D art is enhanced by 3D imagery developed through computer modeling software. Done in the right way, this union of 3D in a 2D animated world can be a very beautiful relationship. The difference lies in what lacks the traditional 2D animation all together and may give term to something produced entirely with 3D graphics (such as the 2006 remake of "Appleseed" , 2007`s "Vexille", the 2008 addition to the "Biohazard" series and the more well known "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within" and "Advent Children").

<description>
Laura Bodewig is a first year student at the IS academy and is the IS cadet representative from Germany. A genetically-engineered super-soldier, Laura is a member of the German military and holds the rank of second lieutenant. She has red eyes and long silver hair. Her most distinct feature is a black eye patch covering her left eye. Her left eye glows yellow, the result of a failed nano-machine experiment that was meant to help her pilot an IS better. Laura was under Chifuyu`s tutelage when the latter was in the German army and holds Chifuyu in high regard as Chifuyu helped her and was her role model when she suffered a depression for not being the strongest. Laura`s original purpose for coming to the IS academy is to punish Ichika, who she blames for his sister withdrawing from the 2nd IS International Fighting Tournament. She was unaware that Ichika has been kidnapped and that Chifuyu had withdrawn in order to go save him. She at first easily defeats Ling and Cecilia but loses to Ichika. In desperation, she vows to kill him and goes berserk but is defeated again by Ichika who also calms and consoles her in the Inter-IS subspace. Upon learning Ichika`s strength is his freedom to choose and helping those around him and Chifuyu`s advice, Laura realises how special Ichika really is and decides to become Ichika`s bodyguard to protect him against the other girls as his "bride" (a misunderstanding of her knowledge of Japanese culture).

<description>
Chifuyu is Ichika`s older sister. She is 24 years old and is in charge of Ichika`s class at the IS academy. She was the Japanese pilot for the first generation IS machines and was said to be the strongest IS pilot at one point before retiring. During her retirement, she looked after her brother and raised him by herself after their parents abandoned them. She deeply cares for Ichika as she sees him as her only family. Chifuyu was also the one who enrolled Ichika to the IS academy to keep him safe from other countries. Chifuyu once wielded Yukihira, a powerful IS energy blade that is now in Ichika`s possession. Chifuyu was a close friend of Tabane Shinonono, the creator of the IS, which explains how their younger siblings became childhood friends. Source: Wiki
